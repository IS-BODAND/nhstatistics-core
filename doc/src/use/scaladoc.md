The ScalaDoc is available at: [soon™](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soon%E2%84%A2)(you can build 
it from source though). If you come from Java a ScalaDoc is like a JavaDoc, but it looks better in the browser and 
likes to break more. A lot more. All of the public classes and methods are documented in the ScalaDoc, so read away. 
However, if you wish to have a bit of a tutorial-like thingy, the followings demonstrate the basic use of the library.


Before going further shall we all pay our respects to the Scala syntax-highlighting in this document.
