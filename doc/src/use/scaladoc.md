The ScalaDoc is available at: soonâ„¢(you can build it from source yourself though (./gradlew scaladoc)). 
If you come from Java a ScalaDoc is like a JavaDoc, but it looks better in the browser and 
likes to break more. A lot more.  
All of the public classes and methods are documented in the ScalaDoc, so read away. 
However, if you wish to have a bit of a tutorial-like thingy, the followings demonstrate the basic use of the library.
It shows the basic class of the library and the basic IO operations one can do with it.

Before going further shall we all pay our respects to the Scala syntax-highlighting in this document.
