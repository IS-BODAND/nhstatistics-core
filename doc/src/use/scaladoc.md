The ScalaDoc is available soon:tm: and if you cloned the repo, it can be build with `./gradlew scaladoc`.
If you also want to build this website you need to have a perl* executable in path, named 'perl', and the 'cutedoc'
executable compiled from [this](https://github.com/NickTheDev/cutedoc) repository's sources, as they don't provide an
executable. I don't fully understand licensing so I don't supply an executable, if someone is somehow a lawyer and can
tell me if I could supply this, I will.

All of the public classes and methods are documented in the ScalaDoc, so read away. 
However, if you wish to have a bit of a tutorial-like thingy, the followings demonstrate the basic use of the library.
It shows the basic class of the library and the basic IO operations one can do with it.

\* Most unix based operating systems have some kind of Perl installed. For MS Windows users there is
[Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com)
