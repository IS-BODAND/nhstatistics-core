Upon browsing the r/Animemes subreddit, I saw a problem arise that could have easily been solved by knowing the 
statistics of hentai tags on nhentai. I though, why isn't there a program that allows easy access to doujin on the site,
while providing all these *necessary* data. Like don't you want to know how many percent of all doujin are taged 
shotacon *and* lolicon without needing to do the math yourself? Sufficient to say, I wanted to so I sacrificed my 
free time to the gods of lust and descended into my neat little basement of programming efficacy. When I emerged, 
having overdosed on caffeine and suffering from great sleep-deprivation, I made myself be accompanied by this little 
library to make it be the bringer of all data used in known processing.
