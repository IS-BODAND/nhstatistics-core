NHentaiStatistics Core. The library you never though you would see. Core of the NHentaiStatistics program, allows the 
download of data from the nhentai.net site. Provides easy-to-use 'HentaiStream's to get and output doujin specified 
by the famous ids. By using these streams one can easily get all data about one doujin without needing to work with 
nhentai's non-existent library. (I really does *not* exist, one post on their blog says it exists, but that's just 
a nasty lie. Most likely got lost in the https transmission.)  

**Why did I make this?**  

Upon browsing the r/Animemes subreddit, I saw a problem arise that could have easily been solved by knowing the 
statistics of hentai tags on nhentai. I though, why isn't there a program that allows easy access to doujin on the site,
while providing all these *necessary* data. Like don't you want to know how many percent of all doujin are taged 
shotacon *and* lolicon without needing to do the math yourself? Sufficient to say, I wanted to so I sacrificed my 
free time to the gods of lust and descended into my neat little basement of programming efficacy. When I emerged, 
having overdosed on caffeine and suffering from great sleep-deprivation, I made myself be accompanied by this little 
library to make it be the bringer of all data used in known processing.
