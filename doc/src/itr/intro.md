NHentaiStatistics Core. The library you never though you would see. Core of the NHentaiStatistics program, allows the 
download of data from the nhentai.net site. Provides easy-to-use 'HentaiStream's to get and output doujin specified 
by the famous ids. By using these streams one can easily get all data about one doujin without needing to work with 
nhentai's non-existent library. (I really does *not* exist, one post on their blog says it exists, but that's just 
a nasty lie. Most likely got lost in the https transmission.)
