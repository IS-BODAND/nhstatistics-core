Ant by itself does not include it's manager, named Ivy, so you need to enable it in your root project node. I also added
a bonus target that does the ivy jar installation so you don't have to do it by hand. Ant and Ivy combo looks quite long
and complicated, but only because I left out everything not-dependency related from everything. Maven is more verbose,
trust me. Ant calls Maven's repositories, resolvers like Sbt as that took it from this.

Enable Ivy:
```xml
<!--In your build.xml-->
<project xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant">
    <!-- Ivy configuration and auto-install target -->
  <available classname="org.apache.ivy.Main" property="ivy.installed"/> 

  <target name="install-ivy" description="Install ivy" unless="ivy.installed">
    <mkdir dir="${user.home}/.ant/lib"/>
    <get dest="${user.home}/.ant/lib/ivy.jar" src="http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/ivy/ivy/2.3.0/ivy-2.3.0.jar"/>
    <fail message="Ivy has been installed. Run the build again"/>
  </target>
  
  <!-- Resolving dependencies from the ivy.xml file -->
  <target name="resolve" description="--> retrieve dependencies with Ivy">
    <ivy:retrieve/>
  </target>
  <!--project settings-->
</project>
```

Adding JitPack:
```xml
<!--In your ivysettings.xml-->
<ivysettings>
  <!-- Other settings -->
  <resolvers>
    <chain name="chain">
      <!-- Other resolvers -->
      <ibiblio name="jitpack" m2compatible="true" root="http://jitpack.io"/>
    </chain>
  </resolvers>
</ivysettings>
```

Adding the dependency:
```xml
<!--In your ivy.xml-->
<dependencies>
    <!-- Other dependencies -->
    <dependency org="com.github.isbodand" name="nhstatistics-core" rev="==!version=="/>
</dependencies>
```
